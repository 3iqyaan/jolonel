# Jolonel
A progress tracker that reinforces action.
## How does it help?
I believe that all ambitious goals can be made tangible and achievable by breaking them down into smaller tasks. Jolonel (hopefully) simplifies creating tasks for your goals, scheduling them, and tracking your progress.
## How does it work?
There are three modes of operation:
1. **Do** - To Create, Start, Edit, Complete, and Delete tasks.
2. **View** - To View tasks Filtered, Sorted, Graphed, and thereby the progress Analyzed and learned from.
3. **Change** - To *Create, Edit, and Delete* Tags, Goals, Schedules, Recurring Tasks, and Priority levels for tags and goals.

Any suggestions are welcome, and would be helpful. I am just starting out.
